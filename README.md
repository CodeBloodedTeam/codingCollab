# codingCollab

The idea is simple: create a coding community that is all inclusive and doesn't intimidate anyone who is just getting started.

CodingCollab is designed to help connect anyone interested in coding, whether you are looking to teach yourself, find a mentor, be a mentor, or even if you're a pro looking to collaborate on a project. Once you join, you become part of a community of coders of all backgrounds and levels. After completing your profile, we match you with other users based on your interests and goals. Some unique matching criteria offered by CodingCollab is based on whether you want to meet in person or limit your interactions to just chatting. We recognize that our field can attract introverts and extroverts alike so to keep in line with our original goal, we set these specific options up for each user and only expose them to users who want the same things.

Future enhancements include: hiding the password as it is entered for login, displaying the user's profile (currently only captured by the db), adding a chat feature, expanding your matched users so you can browse more than just your top matches, and adding more locations to our study locations map where users who want to meet can find some good places based on other user's suggestions.
